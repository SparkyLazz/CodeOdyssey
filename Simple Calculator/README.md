**Day 1 – Learning Python from the Beginning Again**  
📅 *22 August 2025*  

This is a simple calculator program written in Python.  
It supports **addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division**, while handling edge cases such as division by zero.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Add two numbers  
- Subtract two numbers  
- Multiply two numbers  
- Divide two numbers (with zero check)  
- Uses Python `match` statement for operation selection  

---

## 📂 Project Structure
```
calculator.py   # Main script
```

---

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Make sure you have **Python 3.10+** installed (required for `match` statement).  
2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo>.git
   ```
3. Run the program:
   ```bash
   python calculator.py
   ```

---

## 📖 Example Usage
```
Enter the first number : 10
Enter the second number : 5
Choose the execution method [Add | Subtract | Multiply | Divided] : Multiply
===================================================================
10.0 x 5.0 = 50.0
```

## 🎯 Learning Goals
- Practice Python functions  
- Handle user input  
- Use conditional logic (`match-case`)  
- Start documenting my coding journey
