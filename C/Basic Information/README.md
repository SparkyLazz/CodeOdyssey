# 🌱 Code Odyssey  

This project is very first step into **C programming**.  
It contains simple examples to learn the basics of **variables, operators, and conditions** in C.  

---

## 📖 What’s inside this project?  

✅ **Hello World** – The classic starting point.  
✅ **Variables** – How to declare and print different data types:  
- `int` → integers (whole numbers)  
- `float` → decimal numbers  
- `double` → larger decimal numbers  
- `char[]` → strings (text)  

✅ **Operators** – Basic math and operations in C:  
- Addition `+`  
- Subtraction `-`  
- Multiplication `*`  
- Division `/`  
- Modulus `%`  
- Increment `++`  
- Decrement `--`  

✅ **If Statements** – Basic conditions to control the flow of the program.

## 🔮 What’s coming next?  

This is only the beginning 🚀. In future updates, I’ll add:  
- 📦 **Functions** – Reusable blocks of code.  
- 🏛 **Structures & Classes (OOP style)** – Organizing code more efficiently.  
- 🔄 **Loops** – `for`, `while`, `do while`.  
- 📂 **File Handling** – Read and write files.  
- 💡 **Mini Projects** – Small real-world applications in C.

## 🚀 How to Run  

1. Clone this repository  
```bash
git clone <your-repo-link>
```

2. Compile the C file  
```bash
gcc main.c -o main
```

3. Run the program  
```bash
./main
```

## ✨ Notes  

This repository is just **basic C code for learning purposes**.  
It will grow over time as I explore deeper concepts.
